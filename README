# Example Git repository

This is a sample git repository, for use in CITS4407 "Open Source Tools
and Scripting".

Information about the example project would normally go in this
file.

We would also normally create a file called AUTHORS, listing the creators of
the project, and one called LICENSE, outlining the terms on which the code for
the project may be reproduced and distributed.
